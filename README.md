# JRC_Clearcut_Analysis
The scripts in this repository were used to analyse the biomass and harvest data for the JRC CBM. The python scripts are meant to be run in QGIS and the Jupyter and R files take the QGIS output files and analyse them to produce probability distribution graphs and descriptive statistics.
